Installation of SsfPack Basic Version v3.02

==============

* This version of SsfPack Basic is compiled for
  Ox 7 for Windows (XP/7/8), Linux and Mac OS X.
* It does not work with Ox 6. A separate version 
  for Ox 6 can be found on www.ssfpack.com.

--------------

Unzip ssfpack_basic_302.zip in a temporary directory, 
and move or copy the "ssfpack" directory inside "packages"
into the "packages" directory of your Ox installation.

On Windows, this directory is usually found in
  ..\Program Files (x86)\OxMetrics7\ox\packages
or in
  ..\Program Files (x86)\OxMetrics7\ox\packages

On Mac OS X, it is usually 
  /Applications/OxMetrics7/ox/packages

On Linux or other Unix versions, the location is usually
  /usr/share/OxMetrics7/ox/packages


Alternatively, the zip file can be directly unzipped 
into the Ox installation directory. In this case, ensure
that the directory "ssfpack" has been unzipped inside
"ox/packages" of the installed Ox.

After installation, you can check whether it works
using the Ox program ssf3test.ox
